To enhance your experience with the Website, we use "cookies" on our Website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our Website. However, once you become a customer and furnish the Website with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.<br>
<br>
We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Website. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Website (e.g., to recognize you when you return to the Website). With most internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.<br>
<br>
Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of the Website can be accessed only in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content.<br>
<br> The use of cookies by our service partners is not covered by our privacy statement. We do/do not have access or control over these cookies. Our service partners use session ID cookies to allow us to improve site navigation and usage.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>5. Web Beacons</strong><br> <br> Our service partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>6. Children<br></strong><br> The Website is not directed at individuals less than seventeen (17) years of age and Home Helpers United does not intend to collect any personally-identifiable information from such individuals, unless otherwise stated at the time such information is collected.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>7. Information Collected Automatically</strong><br> <br> Home Helpers United may also (i) automatically collect non-personally-identifiable information about your use of the Website, such as the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, Comcast.net, if you are connecting from a Comcast account), the date and time you access the Website, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website; and (ii) use data capture and analysis tools, and other similar tools, to extract, compile and analyze any non-personally identifiable data or information resulting from your use of the Website and the services offered thereon (collectively "Blind Data"). To the extent that any Blind Data is collected by Home Helpers United, such Blind Data shall be solely owned by Home Helpers United and may be used by Home Helpers United for any lawful business purpose, including, without limitation, analyzing and enhancing the Website and services offered.<br> <br> <strong>8. Testimonials</strong><br> <br> We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you wish to request to have your testimonial removed, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@expectingparentsonline.com"><span class="s2">info@homehelpersunited.com</span></a>. &nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>9. Public Forums</strong><br> <br> Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@expectingparentsonline.com"><span class="s2">info@homehelpersunited.com</span></a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>10. Links to Other Websites</strong><br> <br>
The Website may contain links, whose information practices may be different than Home Helpers United. Visitors should consult such sites' privacy notices as Home Helpers United does not have any control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, them. Home Helpers United does not make any representations or warranties as to the security of any information (including, without limitation personal information) you might be requested to provide. <br>
<br>
These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by Home Helpers United. Home Helpers United cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services that you access from a site that links to or from the Website, since these sites are owned and operated independently. <br>
<br> Home Helpers United is not responsible for the content of linked sites and does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such sites. Home Helpers United has not taken any steps to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the information contained in such sites. If you decide to access linked sites, you do so at your own risk. Home Helpers United strongly encourages you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or off-line transaction with any of these sites.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>11. Data Security Policy</strong><br> <br> The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with visitors to the Websiteâas well as Home Helpers United customer information, such as cell phone numbers, email,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>addresses, and other account dataâis of utmost concern to Home Helpers United, and we have implemented, and periodically review, certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security. Your personal information is always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including name and address. Unfortunately, due to the open nature of Internet communications, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, and thus we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Home Helpers United will be free from unauthorized access. Visitors of the Website and Home Helpers United customers use the Website at their own risk.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>12. Your Acceptance of These Terms</strong><br> <br>
By accessing the Website, you signify your assent to Home Helpers United Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Website. You should visit this page periodically, as we may, from time to time, update this Privacy Policy and such changes shall be effectively immediately upon posting on the Website and without further notice to you.&nbsp;<br>
<br> Your continued access to the Website following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy shall be deemed an acceptance of such changes by you. Home Helpers United will, however, use personally-identifiable information only in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>13. Changes in This Privacy Policy</strong><br> <br> We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.&nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>Questions/Concerns?</strong><br> <br> If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@homehelpersunited.com" style="color:blue;">info@homehelpersunited.com.</a><br> </span></p>
